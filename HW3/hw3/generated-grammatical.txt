any fruit carries that defeater .
another corner covers any story .
every Holy Grail rides them coconut .
Arthur is there Holy Grail .
Sir Bedevere covers a chalice .
there chalice carries them husk .
each home is that castle .
them quest rides a fruit .
every fruit is no master .
that sovereign has that Camelot .
every king drinks every Holy Grail .
them Round Table has that master .
there Round Table is that Camelot .
there chalice rides them Holy Grail .
there coconut is the pound .
that Round Table has them king .
this winter is every England .
