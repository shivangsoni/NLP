"""
This is an example of a basic optical character recognition system.
Some components, such as the featurizer, are missing, and have been replaced
with data that I made up.
This system recognizes words produced from an alphabet of 2 letters: 'l' and 'o'.
Words that can be recognized include, 'lol', 'lolol', 'and loooooll'.
We'll assume that this system is used to digitize hand-written notes by Redditors,
or something.

The possible hidden states.
That is, each letter we are trying to recognize could be an 'l' or an 'o'.
'''
states = ('l', 'o',)

'''
Let's say that you have a featurizer (I don't) that creates a feature
vector from a black-and-white input image of a character.
This simple, imaginary featurizer samples 3 one-pixel-wide, vertical strips 
of the character image at fixed x positions. 
For example, the featurizer might look at the left-most column of the image, 
the right-most column, and the center column.
If the featurizer finds black pixels in the strip, it sets that element in the
feature vector to 1; otherwise, the element is set to zero. If many different
images for each character are examined, the featurizer may produce many different
feature vectors, as the images may use different fonts, font sizes, or may be
aligned differently. However, some feature vectors should be produced more
frequently for certain characters. For example, lower-case 'i's should 
infrequently have pixels in the left- or right-most columns, while 'o's should.
After examining many annotated images for each character in the lexicon, 
the featurizer can assign the probabilities of each feature vector corresponding
to each character.
The following are the probabilities that a hidden state emitted an observed state.
That is, these are the probabilities that each possible feature vector 
corresponds to 'l' or 'o'. The presence of black pixels in all three columns indicates
and 'o', but never an 'l'; the presence of black pixels in the last two columns could
indicate either an 'l' or an 'o'; etc.

that 'o' was usually followed by 'o'.
